# Tonarium

A web app for people with a bad musical education. Helps you see what's going on harmonically — scales, chords, progressions — laid out visually across the instrument of your choice.

## Tools

- **Chord Progressions** — browse classic progressions (I–V–vi–IV, ii–V–I, Canon in D, …) in any root key; each chord has a solo tip showing which scale to improvise with
- **Jam Mode** — pick a key and scale to see safe notes highlighted; anchor notes (root, 3rd, 5th) are marked so you always know where to land
- **Scale Visualizer** — see any scale across all 12 notes
- **Chord Detector** — select some notes, find out what chord they make
- **Progression Builder** — arrange your own chord sequence and see it mapped out
- **Claves Mode** — note-to-pad mapping for the EP-1320 layout *(EP-1320 display only)*

## Display Modes

All tools adapt to four layouts, selectable via the Display dropdown:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| EP-1320 | 4×3 chromatic pad grid (Teenage Engineering EP-1320) — default |
| Guitar | 6-string fretboard in standard tuning |
| Piano | Keyboard layout |
| Notes | Plain chromatic note names |

## Development

Clone the repository — it's a plain Vite / Vue 3 app.

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```
